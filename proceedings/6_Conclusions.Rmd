# CONCLUSIONS

1. Common templates for CSAS reports are useful to ensure web access standards and
speedup publishing times for DFO reports.

1. Assisting everyone in the department nationwide with making standard translation
tools between languages ensures rapid and equal quality graphics in documents
and presentations regardless of its original language and its translations.

1. Common graphical standards for different plot types (look and feel) draws more
attention to the advice than the particular mode of presenting it thus seeking
stronger standards in this regards should aid communication of the implication
Science's work, advice and uncertainties in that advice.

1. Using tools that allow traceability, transferable tools such as github,
R-packaging and R-markdown files for documenting and disseminating assessment
code, is a means of promoting a transparent line of work, decisions, assumptions
and known issues which are key components of defensible science advice.

1. These tools allow greater transferability and reproducibility in the
assessment process that permits new staff to come on line quickly and for the
process to better deal with staff changes and absences (e.g. owing to parental
leave).

1. Assessment and advice conforming to TTT can provide strong support for decision
making based on such advice. 

1. Some of these tools require considerable expertise. If these tools are to be
used going forward, dedicated staff and/or training needs to be integrated into
the stock assessment-advice work flow and not simply as a side activity.

1. In addition, using these tools in DFO assessment work can promote greater within
and between region collaboration that can improve the speed and quality of some
science advice.
