# DAY 2

## INTRODUCTION TO R MARKDOWN (EDWARDS)

Edwards presented an intro to the basics of R markdown.
R markdown allows us to interspace text, R code, and R output.
This is then elegantly converted into html, pdf, or word formats using the knitr package and pandoc (a universal document converter).
Markdown is compatible with latex, but is a much simpler to learn markup language. Basic formatting options were presented.
Some recommendations included naming our code chunks using unique and useful descriptions (aids in using caches and finding errors) and that caches are useful when working with large datasets.

## INTRODUCTION TO **csasdown** (ANDERSON)

Pacific region has written an R package called csasdown  (based on bookdown R package) to help authors write research documents formatted for Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat.  

After loading csasdown a template document can be produced using the following R code:

```{r create-draft-csas-doc, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(csasdown)
rmarkdown::draft("index.Rmd", template = "resdoc", package = "csasdown", 
  create_dir = FALSE, edit = FALSE)
```

Using this draft document, we explored how to produce and link figures, tables, and references within a research document.

## OPEN DATA PROTOCOLS (BRUCE PATTEN)

Bruce Patten presented an overview of the Darwin Core (DWC) observational data model and the benefits of its potential application to fisheries science.
This data model provides a standard for representing survey data in a consistent format that allows for integration of datasets from multiple sources.
The DWC model has been extended by the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) initiative to be more useful for marine biological and oceanographic survey data and is called the OBIS-ENV-DATA schema.
He listed several online repositories for biological data that use Darwin Core data standards including [Ocean Biogeographic Information Systes: http://www.iobis.org](http://www.iobis.org) and related R tools (RODBC, robis and obistools R packages).
Several international data sharing initiatives such as OBIS are exchanging data using this format.
Canada has committed to contributing to these efforts and DFO has already participated to some degree.
There are some R packages available that provide the user with tools for interacting with data in the OBIS format of DWC.
Mr. Patten proposes that DFO Science put some effort towards mapping existing databases to the OBIS-ENV-DATA schema with the idea of developing datasets in this format for use by analysts.

## DEFENSIBLE SCIENCE ADVICE (KRONLUND)

A brief overview of the broad implications of Bill C-68 in the context of the DFO PA Framework (DFO 2009) was provided.
Proposed language in Bill [C-68](http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-68/third-reading) implies there will be legislative imperatives for evidence to support management measures to maintain stocks at or above sustainable levels (Provision 6.1(1)), maintain stocks above the Limit Reference Point (Provision 6.1(2)), and rebuild stocks above the Limit Reference Point in the provided time periods (Provision 6.2).
The provisions require taking into account the biology of the fish and environmental conditions affecting the stock.
Fish stocks currently tracked by the [Sustainability Survey for Fisheries](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/reports-rapports/regs/sff-cpd/survey-sondage/index-en.html), and others as needed, will need PA Framework elements to meet requirements under Bill C-68 (i.e., reference points, harvest control rules, consideration of uncertainty).
In general, defending science advice means the advice meets current standards of acceptable scientific and fisheries management practice, including reproducible science, a key element of this workshop.
The suite of software tools discussed in the workshop also enable national standardization of how uncertainty, stock status, and risks associated with management trade-offs are communicated, a step that would also improve the defense of science advice.
