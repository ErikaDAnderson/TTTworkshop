# INTRODUCTION

<!-- Plagarized from the CSAS website -->
The DFO Technical Expertise in Stock Assessment (TESA) program was created in 2008 to help rebuild capacity in fish stock assessment, and to develop technical approaches in a common venue separate from science advisory meetings.
The TESA program is composed of three related elements:

1) Stock Assessment Methods Committee (SAMC);
2) Annual national stock assessment methods workshop; and
3) Stock assessment technical training/upgrading program.

TESA is led by a steering committee composed of the chair (Noel Cadigan), one stock assessment expert from each region, a champion from the National Ecosystem, Oceans and Science Director Committee (NEOSDC), and a Science manager.

<!-- TTT background here -->

The TTT workshop took place in Nanaimo, British Columbia in an interactive classroom setting (Figure \ref{fig:classroom}).
Workshop participants are listed in Table \@ref(tab:participants).
Workshop materials are on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pbs-assess/TTTworkshop).
