# INTRODUCTION

<!-- From the TESA GCpedia site -->
The purpose of the Technical Expertise in Stock Assessment (TESA) program is to
promote stock assessment excellence through organizing national activities that
contribute to the development of expertise in stock assessment across Fisheries
and Oceans Canada (DFO).

In 2009, TESA was created in response to a loss of stock assessment expertise in 
DFO owing to retirements. Each year, TESA organises three or four training courses
and one or two topical workshops on stock assessment issues. TESA is a national
program with one or two representatives in each region. There is an internal
(only accessible from the DFO network) 
[GCpedia page](http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/DFO_Science_TESA_ETES).

<!-- From the abstract -->
A four-day TESA workshop was held in Nanaimo on 27-30 November 2018 to foster a
common understanding of modern methods and tools in DFO that enables an exchange
of knowledge, data, and methods for stock assessment which should lead to
transparent, traceable, and transferable (TTT) assessments in DFO.
\emph{Transparent}: There is a clear and open way to show data, code, and
results, and others should be able to duplicate the assessment;
\emph{Traceable}: One should be able to link results to components; and
\emph{Transferable}: It should be feasible for another person to pick up the
assessment and build on it with a minimal learning curve.  A fourth T could be
\emph{Translatable} in the sense that with two official languages, it is
important to ensure proper document standards to enable consistent translations
between official languages.

The TTT workshop took place in Nanaimo, British Columbia in an interactive
classroom setting (Figure \ref{fig:classroom}).  Workshop participants are
listed in Table \@ref(tab:participants).  Workshop materials are on the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/pbs-assess/TTTworkshop).
