# INTRODUCTION

<!-- Plagarized from the CSAS website -->
The DFO Technical Expertise in Stock Assessment (TESA) program was created in 2008 to help rebuild capacity in fish stock assessment, and to develop technical approaches in a common venue separate from science advisory meetings.
The TESA program is composed of three related elements:

1) Stock Assessment Methods Committee (SAMC);
2) Annual national stock assessment methods workshop; and
3) Stock assessment technical training/upgrading program.

TESA is led by a steering committee composed of the chair (Noel Cadigan), one stock assessment expert from each region, a champion from the National Ecosystem, Oceans and Science Director Committee (NEOSDC), and a Science manager.

<!-- From the abstract -->
A four day workshop was held in Nanaimo on 27-30 November 2018 to foster a common understanding of modern methods and tools in DFO that enables an exchange of knowledge, data, and methods for stock assessment which should lead to transparent, traceable, and transferable (TTT) assessments in DFO.
\emph{Transparent}: There is a clear and open way to show data, code, and results, and others should be able to duplicate the assessment;
\emph{Traceable}: One should be able to link results to components; and
\emph{Transferable}: It should be feasible for another person to pick up the assessment and build on it with a minimal learning curve.
A fourth T could be \emph{Translatable} in the sense that with two official languages, it is important to ensure proper document standards to enable consistent translations between official languages.

The TTT workshop took place in Nanaimo, British Columbia in an interactive classroom setting (Figure \ref{fig:classroom}).
Workshop participants are listed in Table \@ref(tab:participants).
Workshop materials are on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pbs-assess/TTTworkshop).
